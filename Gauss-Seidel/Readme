Problem:

Program the Gauss-Seidel method and test it on the following examples
1]
3x + y + z = 5
x + 3y - z = 3
3x + y - 5z = -1

2]
3x + y + z = 5
3x + y - 5z = -1
x + 3y - z = 3

Solution:
Gauss Seidel method works for an important set of matrices. The diagonally dominant matrices.
A matrix is said to be diagonally dominant if the absolute value of the diagonal is at least as
large as the sum of the absolute values of remaining elements of the same row.

Now considering the first set of given equations:
3x+y+z = 5
X+3y-z = 3
3x+y-5z = -1
Here, the absolute value of the diagonal elements is greater than the sum of the other values in the
corresponding row.
|3| > 1+1; |3| > |1|+|1| ; |5| > |3|+|1| . Thus we see chance of gauss seidel working in this case.
Answer: x1= 1.000 ; x2 = 1.000; x3 = 1.000

But the same doesnâ€™t hold good for the second set of equations:
3x+y+z = 5
3x+y-5z = -1
X+3y-z = 3
The condition of the absolute value of diagonal elements is not satisfied.
|3| > |1|+|1| ; |1| < |3|+|-5|; |1| < |1|+|3|
Thus, there is no solution from gauss seidel for the second set of equations.
